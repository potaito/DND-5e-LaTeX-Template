\part{Ysaac's story}
\section{Summary}
Ysaac was a protector at the secret college in Dunkelberg, where Wizards were doing research. Years ago he was in love with a woman, who was critically injured during an adventure and he had to leave her behind. Plagued by the guilt, he committed his life to protecting those who need protection, which is why he ended up at the college in Dunkelberg. 

Someone took the appearance of the woman he loved and spent enough time with Ysaac to learn about the ins and outs of the college. Armed with that information, this preson seems to have led a raid party and attacked the college. Many wizards were killed or abducted, and numerous research objects were stolen.

Plagued by guilt Ysaac left Dunkelberg and started wandering through the wilderness on his own, as he could not bear the look of other people.

\section{Full background Story}
\subsection{Alone in the Woods}
The past months were particularly hard on Ysaac. He has most of the time been wandering the planes and forests of the land with a bow in his hand. His eyes on the lookout for a deer, or any animal with some meat on it for that matter. Ysaac's face looks roughed up, his beard growing longer every day. It definitely makes him look older than he actually is. But out in the wilds a steamy shower and a barber are the two things he will most likely not find. The cold eather and scarce food caused Ysaac to lose some weight. It's these nights in particular that make him thoughtful about his decisions in the past. When his hunts were unsuccessful and he has to go to sleep hungry, Ysaac wished to just go back to where he lived before and enjoy all the perks of a modern civilization. It would probably also be less cumbersome if he was a capable hunter in any form. In his past Ysaac's job was, simply put, being a guard. In this position you don't have to worry about where to get food or finding shelter. Everything is taken care of. That's one of the benefits when one swears an oath to protect his brothers and sisters. The final events of his first and las assignment ever still haunt him to this day. They were invaded, his friends and colleagues were abducted, tortuered or just killed. Some managed to escape and who knows where they are now. Hopefully safe and hidden, Ysaac thinks. Because whoever was behind that attack is probably still looking for them.

Ysaac did not run away because he was being chased. He was never one to turn away from problems. But he just could not bear the thought that this was all his fault. The secret college was impossible to penetrate. Not many have ever tried, which is why Ysaac's job as a protector was nothing compared to what real soldiers and mercenaries were going through. At least that was until he fell for this... thing.

\subsection{The assault on the college}
On one faithful day a woman who Ysaac once knew, loved and thought he had lost showed up out of nowhere. She was as beautiful as ever and when they met again Ysaac was in shock. Last time he saw her she had injuries that nobody could survive. And yet she was there, standing in front of him. They talked a lot over the course of the next weeks as there was much catching up to be done. Afterall they have not seen each other for at least six years. This is how she.. well... it... gained Ysaac's trust. One day then the secret college was invaded. The attackers were quick and knew exactly where to go, how to cirvumvent the traps and magically sealed doors. These small beasts were heading to the library and laboratories of the college. They stole the technology and research done by Ysaac's fellow friends, most of whom were wizards. 

\begin{DndComment}{Stolen items from the college}
  Some of the stolen items from the college were one of a kind. This includes scrolls and books that might hold an immense value to the magical society. The wizards at the college were investigating these ancient texts.
\end{DndComment}

Alone these monsters would never had the chance to gain access to the college. But they were lead by her. And when she ran into Ysaac, she did not hesitate one second to pull her dagger and stab him in the guts. To add to the insult, she left him lying there, watching how she and the monsters raided the college. On their way out, she looked at him one more time. And as Ysaac's eyes were investigating her, wondering how and why she would do this, he saw her skin beginning to melt. Underneath that skin more, darker skin appeared. It's as if she got rid of her shell, showing her true self. That's at least what Ysaac thought at the time. Meanwhile he knows, that this was a shape shifter. And he also knows that shape shifters never show their true identity. Some even claim that they don't have a real "self", that they always impersonate someone or something.

\subsection{Running away}
Plagued by this guilt, Ysaac had to leave town. He packed one or two books from the library that his dearest wizard friend would often use to teach Ysaac, and left. At fist he tried to run away from his guilt. But after a while his shame, anger and frustration cooled down and he started to formulate a plan. He would go back, and he would find out who did this. Perhaps there was also a chance that he could rescue some of the wizards from whoever was holding them captive - if they are still alive. For now it's best that everyone who once knew him thinks that he's dead. That way he can start following the tracks that the attackers left without having them panic. It's fortunate and a curse at the same time, that he was tricked by a shape shifter. Fortunate, because there are not that many shape shifters in this world. And cursed, because shape shifters don't want to be found. Heck, it's probably even impossible to find one if she.. or he.. does not wan't to be found. Ysaac's best bet is to follow rumours of shape shifters. And perhaps he can use the trinket that "she" left at his place. Although Ysaac is still not sure if she actually forgot the trinket, or left it there on purpose. Be that as it may, he will find her. Maye not tomorrow, but some day.

\subsection{The calling}
In the meantime he will continue to hone his fighting skills. And he will continue to study magic. For the longest time of his life, Ysaac had no access to magic of any kind. His trusted companions were a sword and a solid shield. Magic was a domain, a power that was hidden from him. But during these many quiet moments in the bastion, two friends of Ysaac's started to lead Ysaac towards the art of magic. They showed him how he can actually learn to use simple magic to protect himself or others, or to make his sword strike stronger. One of the books that Ysaac took with him from the Bastion was a small collection of spells, that he would often use to study on his own. His friends even told him about a very powerful spell that would let him disappear, and then reappear at a location 30 feet further away. He wishes that he learned this trick. If he had, he could now use it to reappear behind one of those bloody deers and break his kneck. It would certainly make the hunt much easier.

\subsection{The Empire}
The "old world" where humans are from. They speak with a german accent. The empire is a rather mixed place with all kinds of races running around, except for those snobbish elves. The empire is also known for their wizards and colleges.

\subsection{Dunkelberg - Reiksland}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{dunkelberg.png}
Southernmost of the Reikland's major trade centres, the market town stretches across several hills along the banks of the River Grissen. The older, richer portions of the town sit high on the hills, giving the nobles, and the rising merchant class wealthy enough to afford the oldest townhouses, a commanding view of the surrounding countryside. Despite its ever-increasing size, travellers note Dunkelberg's "rustic" feel, with regular markets clogging its winding streets. There shoppers can purchase livestock; local produce; several excellent, fruity wines produced by the surrounding villages; and hand-crafted goods from across the Suden Vorbergland. Wide-ranging "bleachfields" extend from the town, where local linen is dyed white by the sun around crops.

Dunkelberg's position near the looming Grey Mountains and the wild Graugrissen forest leads to regular raids by Goblin tribes. While the richer portions of the town are well fortified and protected by a high, stone wall, the rest lack any significant defences. As such, the poorer citizenry have learned not to grow too attached to their homes, belongings, or loved ones.
