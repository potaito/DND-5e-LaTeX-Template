\chapter{Ysaac Wächter}
\section{Background story}
\subsection{Summary}
Ysaac was a protector at the secret college in Dunkelberg, where Wizards were doing research. Years ago he was in love with a woman, who was critically injured during an adventure and he had to leave her behind. Plagued by the guilt, he committed his life to protecting those who need protection, which is why he ended up at the college in Dunkelberg. 

Someone took the appearance of the woman he loved and spent enough time with Ysaac to learn about the ins and outs of the college. Armed with that information, this preson seems to have led a raid party and attacked the college. Many wizards were killed or abducted, and numerous research objects were stolen.

Plagued by guilt Ysaac left Dunkelberg and started wandering through the wilderness on his own, as he could not bear the look of other people.

\subsection{Full background Story}
\subsubsection{Alone in the Woods}
The past months were particularly hard on Ysaac. He has most of the time been wandering the planes and forests of the land with a bow in his hand. His eyes on the lookout for a deer, or any animal with some meat on it for that matter. Ysaac's face looks roughed up, his beard growing longer every day. It definitely makes him look older than he actually is. But out in the wilds a steamy shower and a barber are the two things he will most likely not find. The cold eather and scarce food caused Ysaac to lose some weight. It's these nights in particular that make him thoughtful about his decisions in the past. When his hunts were unsuccessful and he has to go to sleep hungry, Ysaac wished to just go back to where he lived before and enjoy all the perks of a modern civilization. It would probably also be less cumbersome if he was a capable hunter in any form. In his past Ysaac's job was, simply put, being a guard. In this position you don't have to worry about where to get food or finding shelter. Everything is taken care of. That's one of the benefits when one swears an oath to protect his brothers and sisters. The final events of his first and las assignment ever still haunt him to this day. They were invaded, his friends and colleagues were abducted, tortuered or just killed. Some managed to escape and who knows where they are now. Hopefully safe and hidden, Ysaac thinks. Because whoever was behind that attack is probably still looking for them.

Ysaac did not run away because he was being chased. He was never one to turn away from problems. But he just could not bear the thought that this was all his fault. The secret college was impossible to penetrate. Not many have ever tried, which is why Ysaac's job as a protector was nothing compared to what real soldiers and mercenaries were going through. At least that was until he fell for this... thing.

\subsubsection{The assault on the college}
On one faithful day a woman who Ysaac once knew, loved and thought he had lost showed up out of nowhere. She was as beautiful as ever and when they met again Ysaac was in shock. Last time he saw her she had injuries that nobody could survive. And yet she was there, standing in front of him. They talked a lot over the course of the next weeks as there was much catching up to be done. Afterall they have not seen each other for at least six years. This is how she.. well... it... gained Ysaac's trust. One day then the secret college was invaded. The attackers were quick and knew exactly where to go, how to cirvumvent the traps and magically sealed doors. These small beasts were heading to the library and laboratories of the college. They stole the technology and research done by Ysaac's fellow friends, most of whom were wizards. 

\begin{DndComment}{Stolen items from the college}
  Some of the stolen items from the college were one of a kind. This includes scrolls and books that might hold an immense value to the magical society. The wizards at the college were investigating these ancient texts.
\end{DndComment}

Alone these monsters would never had the chance to gain access to the college. But they were lead by her. And when she ran into Ysaac, she did not hesitate one second to pull her dagger and stab him in the guts. To add to the insult, she left him lying there, watching how she and the monsters raided the college. On their way out, she looked at him one more time. And as Ysaac's eyes were investigating her, wondering how and why she would do this, he saw her skin beginning to melt. Underneath that skin more, darker skin appeared. It's as if she got rid of her shell, showing her true self. That's at least what Ysaac thought at the time. Meanwhile he knows, that this was a shape shifter. And he also knows that shape shifters never show their true identity. Some even claim that they don't have a real "self", that they always impersonate someone or something.

\subsubsection{Running away}
Plagued by this guilt, Ysaac had to leave town. He packed one or two books from the library that his dearest wizard friend would often use to teach Ysaac, and left. At fist he tried to run away from his guilt. But after a while his shame, anger and frustration cooled down and he started to formulate a plan. He would go back, and he would find out who did this. Perhaps there was also a chance that he could rescue some of the wizards from whoever was holding them captive - if they are still alive. For now it's best that everyone who once knew him thinks that he's dead. That way he can start following the tracks that the attackers left without having them panic. It's fortunate and a curse at the same time, that he was tricked by a shape shifter. Fortunate, because there are not that many shape shifters in this world. And cursed, because shape shifters don't want to be found. Heck, it's probably even impossible to find one if she.. or he.. does not wan't to be found. Ysaac's best bet is to follow rumours of shape shifters. And perhaps he can use the trinket that "she" left at his place. Although Ysaac is still not sure if she actually forgot the trinket, or left it there on purpose. Be that as it may, he will find her. Maye not tomorrow, but some day.

\subsubsection{The calling}
In the meantime he will continue to hone his fighting skills. And he will continue to study magic. For the longest time of his life, Ysaac had no access to magic of any kind. His trusted companions were a sword and a solid shield. Magic was a domain, a power that was hidden from him. But during these many quiet moments in the bastion, two friends of Ysaac's started to lead Ysaac towards the art of magic. They showed him how he can actually learn to use simple magic to protect himself or others, or to make his sword strike stronger. One of the books that Ysaac took with him from the Bastion was a small collection of spells, that he would often use to study on his own. His friends even told him about a very powerful spell that would let him disappear, and then reappear at a location 30 feet further away. He wishes that he learned this trick. If he had, he could now use it to reappear behind one of those bloody deers and break his kneck. It would certainly make the hunt much easier.

  "Fat armor is good, being faster than the enemy is better" \\
  Generally good with weapons for close quarters combat \\
  Strategic thinking, probably because Ysaac was involved in the defense plans for the college. \\
  Being at a secret college influenced Ysaac's enunciation and sometimes he speaks too fancily compared to the simpler people in Dunkelberg \\
  Ysaac's friends at the college started to teach him about magic. He is now more affine to magic than regular kinds of soldiers or mercenaries.
\end{DndTable}

\begin{DndTable}[header=Ideals]{XX}
  In general, fighting is the last resort. Shedding blood should be avoided whenever possible. But... if nothing else helps... \\

  Protect those who can't protect themselves
\end{DndTable}

\begin{DndTable}[header=Bonds]{XX}

\DndArea{The Old World}
Old world isch alles vo empire bis old world undem zwerge Land rächts vom empire.

\DndArea{The Empire}
The "old world" where humans are from. They speak with a german accent. The empire is a rather mixed place with all kinds of races running around, except for those snobbish elves. The empire is also known for their wizards and colleges.

Eusi empire Gründigsgschicht fangt a im Jahr 0 (jez Jahr 2522). Da häts verschideni tribes gä vo Mänsche. De wichtigschti sind Uthones, agfüehrt vom Sigmar Heldenhammer. Bis det ane simmer vo "Greenskins" (Orks etc.) regiert worde. Und de Sigmar Heldenhammer hät die Greenskins vertribe. Zwerge händ es ähnlichs Problem gha mti de Orks. Im Black Fire Pass häts de final showdown gä. Zwerge sind dete stuck gsi und vo Orks umzignled. Zwerge hqnd en hilferuef zum Sigmar gschickt. Sigmar hät all Armee zum Black Fire Pass versammled und det de fetti fight agfange. Wo de Sigmar fasch besiegt gsi isch, hät en Zwerg ihm en magische Warhammer zuegworfe, wo ihn revigurated hät und er 200 Orks elei verbängled hät.

\begin{DndSidebar}[float=!b]{Sigmar Heldenhammer}
  Sigmar Heldenhammer isch eusi Religion. 300-400 Jahr nach sim Tot händ Kults agfange ihn als Gott z'verehre. Isch die dominantischti Religion. Wird nöd gern gse, wänn no die alte barbarische Götter abättet werded. Die sogenannte Rune priests. Das sind chli Fanatiker wo Sigmar Ahänger agriifed. Und vo dene Fanatiker gits je länger je me. Im Norde vom Empire isch mer zimli en Heretic wänn mer öpper andersch als de Sigmar abätted.
\end{DndSidebar}

\begin{DndSidebar}[float=!b]{Alliance between empire and dwarves}
  Militärischi Allianz zwüsched Zwerge und Empire. Heiligschti Allianz bis hüt! Kulture sind Ko-abhängig. De Warhammer gits immerno, de ghal'Maraz. De Warhammer isch s'Symbol vo de Reikland Regierig.
\end{DndSidebar}

\DndArea{Reikland}
% \includegraphics[scale=0.07]{reikland_map.png}
Speziell a Reikland isch dass sie vo jedem vo de 10 Länder en elector count hät. Wänn de emperor stirb, wird under de 10 elector count en neue emperor gwählt. Wie de elector count bestimmt wird isch je nach provinz andersch. In Reikland wird er vom Volk gwählt. Bi de anderne vermuetli au I guess. Sit öppe 400 Jahr isch de Emperor immer us Reikland gsi. Im Moment de Karl Franz 1st, sit öppe 20 Jahr.

\DndSubArea{Altdorf}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{image_altdorf.png}
Hauptstadt vo Reikland.
Wichtigi Ort: Kaiserlichi Palast und Kathedrale vom Sigmar. 
Drecksack slum, slum halt. 
University District det bini vor allem gsi. Det sind Magier und so. 
In Altdorf gits verschideni Colleges für jedi Magie Schuel (usser Necromancy).
Die Riiche wohned im Palast distrikt bim Kaiserliche Palast.
Rächts vom university district isch de handels distrikt.
Grundsätzlich e schöni Stadt, bis uf die Drecksack slum halt.
Es git es College of Illusion, aber es staht nieneds, respektive mer gsehts nöd. Magier säged "Moll es git es college of illusion, aber mer muens nur finde.". Mer seit es seg nöd uf dere Plane, sondern muen de Igang finde zum det ine cho.
In Altdorf häts im Süde en Zoo mit Tier und Monsters.
Greife werded det au züchtet. Most prestigious mount im Empire. De Karl riitet so eine.


\begin{DndComment}{Altdorf's dominant force}
  I de Hauptsadt Altdorf gits e anderi dominanti Force als Reikguard Knights.
\end{DndComment}

\DndSubArea{Dunkelberg - Reiksland}
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{dunkelberg.png}
Southernmost of the Reikland's major trade centres, the market town stretches across several hills along the banks of the River Grissen. The older, richer portions of the town sit high on the hills, giving the nobles, and the rising merchant class wealthy enough to afford the oldest townhouses, a commanding view of the surrounding countryside. Despite its ever-increasing size, travellers note Dunkelberg's "rustic" feel, with regular markets clogging its winding streets. There shoppers can purchase livestock; local produce; several excellent, fruity wines produced by the surrounding villages; and hand-crafted goods from across the Suden Vorbergland. Wide-ranging "bleachfields" extend from the town, where local linen is dyed white by the sun around crops.

Dunkelberg's position near the looming Grey Mountains and the wild Graugrissen forest leads to regular raids by Goblin tribes. While the richer portions of the town are well fortified and protected by a high, stone wall, the rest lack any significant defences. As such, the poorer citizenry have learned not to grow too attached to their homes, belongings, or loved ones.


College in Dunkelberg im Averland, will de Herrscher da sehr wissbegierig uf magie isch.

\begin{DndSidebar}[float=!b]{Wizard college of Dunkelberg}
  In Dunkelberg isch mis college, aber isch es minor college. Minor au biz us Absicht. In Altdorf häts scho grösseri College. Das in Dunkelberg isch eher staatlich orientiert und es wird sich mit Sache beschäftigt wo villicht susch niemer interessiered. Ethisch villicht nöd immer ganz korrekt. Magischi versüech mit mänsche. "Zweck heiligt die Mittel". Sache mit curses. Alti items und artefakt chönd cursed si. Anstatt ine iron box sperre und vergabe, tüend mirs eher untersueche. Das gseht mer a de grosse colleges nöd so gern. Aber im Empire ischs lang nonig verbote. S'Empire isch sehr open minded. Im Empire häts es college mit verbotenem shit.
\end{DndSidebar}


\DndSubArea{Frederheim}
Det häts es grosses Asylum wo all crazy people ine gschobe werded. Crazy town! Isch link vo Altdorf. S'ganze Dorf isch e gschlosseni Astalt. Betreuigspersonal isch im Dorf drin und wohnt det. Is Dorf cha mer ga, is Asylum zimli sicher nöd. Mer cha au öpperem säge er söll is Frederheim zum säge, dass er/sie crazy isch.

\DndSubArea{Nuln}
Nuln isch in Wissenland. Zweitgrößchti stadt im empire und wichtig für eus. Det isch d holy school of engineering. Det sind vill zwerge ume zum schaffe. Mer seit das Nuln schwarz isch, will oft die halb Stadt explodiert (gunpowder experiment). Sehr industrielli Stadt. Nöd so wie die schöne farm villages im Norde. Vill tech, Waffe, Rüschtige. Ich ha s'Gfühl, dass vill zwerge in Nuln sind zum luege dass d'Mänsche nie würkli s'Gheimnis vo Gunpowder usefindet. Zwerge chönd ebe nöd zaubere. Magischi Waffe herstelle ja, aber Zaubere nei! Drum sind zwerge au nöd so fan vo Magic.

\DndSubArea{Marienburg}
Free city, gröschti Handelsstadt vo de Wält so wiit ich weiss, ghört nöd zum empire. Will vor x 100 Jahr de erschti emperor mit gamble en schuldeberg ufabut hät. Er isch zu Marienburg go nach Gäld bettle. Die händs im Gschänkt im Gegezug zu de independence. Das isch bis jez so. Da händ mir nöd so freud dra, will sie beriichered sich am Empire. Aber agriiffe wär schwirig wägem Sumpf rundume, und will anderi Regione das nöd toleriere würded. bi no nie det gsi.

\begin{DndComment}{Independence of Marienburg today}
  Das isch bis jez so. Da händ mir nöd so freud dra, will sie beriichered sich am Empire. Aber agriiffe wär schwirig wägem Sumpf rundume, und will anderi Regione das nöd toleriere würded. bi no nie det gsi.
\end{DndComment}



\DndSubArea{Provinz of Sylvania}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{sylvania.jpeg}
Provinz of Sylvania, ghört zu Stirland, aber isch au scho independent gsi. Die sind richtig backwards im Vergliich zum rescht vom empire. Die Adlige vo Sylvania säged offe nei zu de Regierig vo Stirland und regiered sich sälber. Aber wird toleriert, wills vill Sumpf isch, und obe en Wald mit Untote. De Grund, seit mer, will de jetzig Lord vo Sylvania es Magic College betriibt wo a Mänsche experimentiert und die untote im Umfeld studiert. Ihm wird d'Schuld gä für die "failed experiments" wo umelaufed, also die Untote. 

\begin{DndReadAloud}
  Grücht wo ich weiss: Im Castle Drakenhof wird ziwilichtig Magie gmacht / glehrt. Option: Mini Busle isch det ane gange und ich ha sie nie me gse. Aber au untoti beschwöre isch im Empire nöd per se verbote. De Adlig Mafred Von Carstein isch de inoffizielli, praktischi Herrscher vo Sylvania. Wird allgemein als Necromancer betrachtet.
\end{DndReadAloud}



\DndSubArea{Kemperbad}
Stadt Kemperbad isch wichtig. Isch e Gränzstadt vo 3 Provinze, Reikland, Stirland und Talabecland. Drum wichtig für de Handel. Und gränzt au direkt a zwei flüss wo wichtig sind, eine devo gaht richtig Altdorf.

\begin{DndSidebar}[float=!b]{Transportation of goods!}
  Die meischte Goods werded uf flüss transportiert. City of Kemperbad is important, because two rivers pass right next to it. Bogenhafen is also of importance because because it's the furthest point north that can be reached by ship.
\end{DndSidebar}

\DndSubArea{Bogenhafen}
Bogenhafen isch au wichtig will mer nur bis det ane chunt mitem Schiff, aber nöd wiiter. Darum sammled sich det vill goods vo de Stedt im Norde.

\DndSubArea{Grey Lady Pass}
Grey Lady pass isch gföhrlich. Vor allem Orks und Goblins sind det. Die sind ja entweder i de Wälder oder i de Berge dehei. Goblins raided mängisch villages und verpissed sich bevor d'Reikguard uftaucht.

\DndSubArea{Axe Bite Pass}
% \includegraphics{image_axe_bite_pass.png}
Axe Bite pass isch eher zivilisiert.

\DndSubArea{Castle Reigkuard}
Castle Reigkuard, bilder Reikguar Nights us, head vo de elite truppe vo reikland. Kei Miliz, sondern Bruefsarmee. Dadurch sehr guet verteidigt. 
Bi eus isch de Reikland Forest, wo für die Wält relativ sicher isch. Mer findet villicht wildi Tier oder ganz sälte en Goblin, aber susch sehr safe. Im Undere teil vill farmin. Sehr sichers Läbe.

\begin{DndReadAloud}
  Ich ha welle Reikguard Knight werde, aber fürd usbildig häts wohl nöd glanged. Reikguard knight sind knights in shining armor, wür mini disziplin erchläre und warum ich die schwache schütze. Im Castle Reikguard isch Usbildigsstte und Hauptquartier vo de Reikguard Knights. Das sind die beschte vo de beschte im Empire.
\end{DndReadAloud}

\DndSubArea{Ubersreik}
Ubersreik isch e grossi Burg wo de Pass bewacht. Military city. Det chunt mer nöd dra verbi zum pass ohni bemerkt zwerde.

\DndSubArea{Castle Ubersreik}
Ubersreik isch e grossi Burg wo de Pass bewacht. Military city. Det chunt mer nöd dra verbi zum pass ohni bemerkt zwerde.

\DndSubArea{Castle Drachenfels}
Castle Drachenfels isch abandonned. Legende häts dass det en grosse dude s'gröschte castle ever hät welle baue.

\DndArea{Bretonnia}
Links vo eus Bretonnia, Franzose, au Mänsche. Empire und Bretonnia sind Nachbere und händs prinzipiell guet mitenand, aber politisch gse grundlegend anderi Idee. Bretonnia isch e Monarchie mit König und Grafe, Empire nöd. Bretonnia hät en grosse gap zwüsche arm und riich. D Miliz sind armi Puure. Bretonnia hät aber au e Ritter Kultir und sie händ sogar en "Code of chivalery". Das isch d'Elitetruppe vo de Armee. Ritter werde chönd usschliesslich Nobli und Manne. Und zum Ritter werde muemer queste, also Questing Knights.
Empire und bretonnia händ kei militärischi Allianz. Vermuetli will s'Empire das nöd will. Bretonnia isch eher chli temperamentvoll wänn mer sie beleidigt oder so. Aber wür jez Bretonnia hardcore invaded werde vo Orks, wür empire vermuetli scho hälfe.
S'Empire isch au e Diktatur, aber e gwählti.
Bretonnia Religion: Huldiget fasch all d'Lady of the lake.

\DndArea{Fstalia}
Südlich vo Bretonnia sind Fstalia, Tilea und boarder prints (?). Estalia Mänsche, gueti Seefahrer und duellischte. Grundsätzlich sehr fighty, aber e frei Kultur. Gäld regiert d'Wält in Estalia. Die riichste händ s'Säge. Tilea isch sehr ähnlich ufbaut und ähnlich temperamentvoll. Aber nöd ganz so fighty wie Estalia. Händ aber bekannti Assassins in Tilea. S'Spezielle a Tilea dass sie e Insel "sartosa" händ, was die gröscht Pirate Stronghold vo de Wält sta hät. Das sind Tieflings. Alles Pirate!!! Ich weiss wenig über Tieflings, usser wie sie usgsehnd.

\DndArea{World Edge Mountains}
Rächts vom Empire sind World Edge mountains. Det regiered zwerge. Das sind eusi verbündete sind ewig, jahr 0. En wichtige Ort isch de Black fire Pass. Über Black Fire Pass chunt mer zu de Boarder Princes. Das isch biz es Fangbecki für Lüt wo im empire und bretonnia kei platz händ. Mer weiss nöd vill über d regierig. Mer munkled dass es sehr kriminell isch und es herts Pflaster. WEnig handel i die Richtig. Cut-throat gegend.

\DndArea{Kislev}
Im Norde icsh Kislev, au mänsche, Russe, sind herti Lüt und grundsätzlich friendly. MIt dene traded mir. 
Ich weiss Kislev händ spezielli Ice magic, sie chönd Schnee channelle. Über Kieslev sidn Northern wasted und über die weiss mer so gar nix. 
Kieslev sind so Guardians vo de ganze old world. Technologisch und magisch öppe uf de gliiche stufe wie s'empire, eifach ohni gunpowder.

\DndArea{Sea of Claws}
Sea of Claws, Nordsee, sehr es fiises Meer. Nordländers sind Vikinger, herti sieche, die sind uf de andere siite vo Sea of Claws. Mir sind sicher kei allies mit dene. Und die zeiged sich jez au nöd grad wänns im Empire sind.

\DndArea{Bad Lands}
Bad lands im Süde: ORKS!

\DndArea{Ulthuan}
An island where high elves live. I don't know much about them, except that they live long and are stunningly beautiful. The wizards at the college also said that high elves have the best mages in the world.

\DndArea{Nassarosh}
Nassarosh (Nord Amerika) weissi nix, det sind dark elves, det gaht mer nöd ane.

\DndArea{New world}
New world, Süd Amerika, det ane gönd immer me lüt wäg de Märkt. Det gäbs richess, aber keis farm land. Also es isch nöd sehr iladend.

\chapter{Races}
\subsection{Orcs}
Bunch of plundering, barbaric assholes

\subsection{High Elves}
Live long, pretty and the best mages. They have an embassy in the Empire's capitol Altdorf. Occasionalyl elves cna be seen there, but outside of Altdorf I have never met an elf. I think they have political interests in the Empire, but I'm not sure. Can count on one hand how many elves I have encountered in my life. There are other places where they have embassies as well.

\subsection{Humans}
We also have good mages, but for humans magic is something that they have to work hard for. I don't think it comes naturally to many of us.

\subsection{dwarves}
D'zwerge supplied en grossteil vo de Armee. Sie supplied d'Mänsche im Epire mit guns und cannons. Die einzige Mänsche wo zuegang zu dere TEchnologie händ. Mir gänd ihne im Gägezug Ässe. Mir wüssed nöd wie gunpowder mache, also wies d'zwerge mached. Dwarfs hani scho vill gse, vor allem will ich nöch anere dwarf hold wohne. Dwarfs händ kei vorurteil, sondern urteiled extrem am Verhalte und Actions. Vor allem ihne gägenüber. And dwarfs do hold a grudge. Thorgrim Grudgehammer. jede zwerg hät es book of grudges, wo er sini grudges ufschriib und was sini vorgstellt Kompensation wär. Zwege chömed spöter uf de grudge zruf und fordered oft Gäld. Wänn mer sich widersetzt wird de Zwerg zu sim Lord ga. De Lord wird de Grudge i sis eigene Grudge buech schriibe, und als Clan nomal eim go konfrontiere cho. De Priis wird dänn aber höcher natürli. Das ganze wird wiitergspillt, bis mer im buech of grudges vom ganze fucking zwerge könig landet, und s'ganze zwergeriich en grudge gäg eim hät.

En Elf hät ageblich mal anerem zwerg de Bart abgschnitte und det segs zu sonerem nationale grudge cho. Das seg au de Grund, warums da kei Elfestädt git i de ganze Oldworld. Zwerge sind homies vo mir und ich weiss wie umga mit ine (Respektvoll).


\subsection{Other races}
Vo Lizard men weissi nix. 

Und Dark elves weissi dass sie existiered, me aber nöd. Vo Wood elves weissi au nix, für mich gits eifach elves und dark elves.

Tieflings. Alles Pirate!!! Ich weiss wenig über Tieflings, usser wie sie usgsehnd.

\chapter{The play}
\section{Episode 0 - The Tournament}
Ich ga nacher Paravon a das Tournament, because I need money. Ich ga über de safe Pass (Axe Bite Pass). Ich ha ghört dass de Königssohn vo Bretonnia hürated und das Turnier isch zu sine Ehre. Ich wird dete wohl kämpfe müesse.

Carcion isch de Vater vom prinz wo mich ibuchte will. Carcion isch de duke vo Paravon.

\section{Episode 1 - The Prison}
Bin im Gfängnis verwached. Und grad mal vo de zwei Wache attackiert worde. Hueresöhn.

\subsection{Getting to know each other}

\subsubsection{Beladin (Simi)}
Name is Belading Savh or something, and he is from some house of Saffori. Elf, mit elegante servant robe, schwarzi Haar. Not only is he sneaky and good with his hants (he stole the guard's keys twice from within his cell), but he can also use magic.

\subsubsection{Garret (Bäsche)}
Garret "The Halfblood". Schliichi Boi. So en guy. Wearing regular servant uniform. Looks human, mittellangi haar. en dut obe. schwarzi haar. Bäsche gseht jung us, so 23, und bleich

\subsubsection{Celine (Dilara)}
Celine Naroux with an "x". from Brion, the port. Fancy dress, is a witch and can cast spells. She told me that men in Bretonnia are not allowed to use magic. That makes my existence illegal I guess?

\subsubsection{Davasas (Tobias)}
Name is "Davasas" or "Darasas". Or "Daras Ras"? He is from Lostria, the swamps in Lostria to be more precise. Schwarze dude wo voll abgmageret usgseht. Mittleres Alter. 

\subsection{The interrogation}
Apparently the King is dead and all suspects are sitting here in the prison with me. I seem to be a suspect as well, since I was alone in a room with the King for a minute.

We are being interrogated because the future king (prince) thinks we poisoned the king's water.

Garret was hired as a servant. Beladin says a swordman told him to keep an eye on Garret during the festival. That's how he ended up in the king's room. Celine was riding a fancy white horsy and lost control of it. The horse happened to have thrown her off its back in such a way, that she crashed through the window into the king's room. And Davasas came to the prison in order to save Celine. Guess that didn't work out too well. He seems to be her protector because he's very concerned about her well-being.

\subsection{Her highness saves the day}
I met a new aqueintance, princess Harrieth. She came to save Beladin. Said we would all be executed in the next morning. All 5 of us were freed and she sent us down through the sewers, said we should leave Bretonnia as quickly as possible. My guess is that she freed all of us to increase Baladin's chances of survival. 

During this short meet and greet with the princess, Celine asked about some Crystal. But we don't have time for this now. Princess Harrieth rumours though that the king's murder was staged by the Paravonians. She said it's very uncommon that they would execute an elf like Beladin. And she definitely did not seem amused about this. 

Princess harrieth staged a prison riot by charming the guards and commanding them to open all prison cells and start fighting the prisoners. This should allow us to escape through the sewers unnoticed.


\section{Episode 2 - The Sewers}
It's dark. Garret walked off in front of us. Celine cast a spell and a bright fire appeared in her hands, giving us some light in this disgusting place.

The sewers seem like a maze. There's more than just one path and nobody in the group really knows where to go. It looks like Garret is following the flow of the water, which makes sense. His reasoning is, that the folks don't want the brown water inside the city, so it must be flowing outwards. 

Celine jumped into the poopy water to check something. Not sure what good came out of it. When I lifted her out, I noticed that she's actually heavier than she looks. Also, her dress seems to be an illusion. It doesn't feel right and it did not get dirty when she was swimming in the mud.

A few moments later Celine spotted a Kobold friend who's leading us to his hideout and wants to trade. Once we arrived at his "home", we saw that it's some kind of holdout with more of these guys. And they all want to trade. It also appears that there is one Kobold leader and his name is Snolti. They are quite fond of Celine's magic and went completely nuts when she lit her hand on fire. Celine is convinced that the Kobolds know a way out and can draw a map for us. I on the other hand do't believe they even know what a map is. But perhaps they can still be of use to us. Since the Kobolds are so fascinated by Celine's fire, I offered them a torch in exchange for showing us the way out of the sewers. They took the offer and the Kobold we spotted first is ordered to lead us to the Forest.

While following this little guy, Celine tells me about bretonnian greil knights, who are supposed to be quite legendary. I'm surprised I never heard anything about them. And I am pretty damn sure that they pale in comparison to the Reikguard Knights!

Meanwhile Kekk, our little Kobold friend, led us to a "Forest". At least that's what he believes. We arrived at a place where the tree roots entereed the sewers through the walls. So we are still trapped down here and there's no sunlight anywhere.

Davasas tried to figure out what kind of tree these roots belong to and wanted to cut a piece of the root when Beladin suddenly attacked him. Beladin wnet completely nuts and was trying to actually harm Davasas. We held him back and from one second to the other Beladin turned normal again. I don't really understand these folks, but to me he appeared to be in a ragy trance or something.

Kekk mentioned that there is a castle straight above us. This is not really where we want to be while ESCAPING A PRISON. Garret is asking Kekk to guide us to a place without a castle and without guards, but with forest. "Forest, no castle!" That's the deal. Kekk said that there's danger in the Forest, so we had to rephrase. "Danger good! Danger, Forest, no castle!" I gave Kekk another torch as a payment for guide us a second time. I really was not in the mood of going back to Snolti another time to make an official trade.

Lo and behold, Kekk actually brought us to the exit of a sewer. He snatched a key from a guard's post that's down here in the sewers and opened the gate for us. Once we passed it, he was really keen to close it again because of the scary dangers.

Immediately after we passed the gate, we stumbled upon a dead body. Didn't seem like the guy was dead for long. This should have been a warning to us. Because not long after we found the body, we were attacked by creatures. First rats. But not the usual ones. These were larger and ferocious. And as if that wasn't enough, some weird looking tiny armored guys came after the rats and also charged at us with their puny little swords. This would all not have been an issue my group wasn't already nearly dead. For most of the fight I was actually also on the brink of blacking out. I knew I had to endure just a little bit longer and we would be free once again. And somehow we managed to get rid of the foes one by one. I don't know how really, because except for Garret and Darasas I did not notice much from my fellow prison friends, as they were all standing behind me. I must also admit that Darasas saved my life. Not sure how exaclty he did it, but when he touched me, I felt the strength returning to my body. Similarly to the healers that brought me back into existance after the fight at the tournament a few days earlier. I am also not exactly sure what Beladin was doing during this fight. But at one point he was standing in the sewer canal covered in shit from top to bottom. Even his face was muddy. Not sure if he tried to hide in the water and then figured out, that this is worse than dying. Be that as it may, we made it out alive of this situation and stepped into the forests a few moments later. Seeing the sunlight again is a lovely sensation. The forest also seems quite peaceful. 

We were discussing where we should head to next. Our safest bet is to get to Reikland. Once we reach the mountains between Reikland and Bretonnia, we can count on the dwarves' friendship. At least as long as we are not taking the Grey Lady pass. Unforutnately though the Grey Lady pass seems to be the only option we have from where we are standing right now, unless we are willing to stroll through a Bretonnian town to make it to the Axe Bite pass. But the guards would probably recognize us before we even get close to the pass. So Grey Lady pass it is then! I just need to find some rest so that I can keep our group safe. Last I heard there are trolls hiding on that pass. It will therefore be best if we try to go over it as sneakily as possible. I have no doubt that my companions can do this. Except for Celine perhaps. She does not seem to take things too seriously. I can't really tell what it is with her.

This is now day 3 of our adventure. I spent one day at the tournament, got healed up, in the evening I met the king, was thrown in jail soon after. The next day we were interrogated by the detective. In the night of day two, the princess freed us and in the morning of day three we were escaping through the sewers.

Oh and I also learned that Garret is from Marienburg. That explains his rebellish attitude.

\section{Episode 3 - A considerable military force}
We knotted 4 ropes together to climb down a cliff to our left, which would get us down to the forest. I attached one end of the rope and threw the other end down. Something tore on it and the rope snapped. Celine keeps talking about moving trees. Interestingly enough the rope snapped somewhere in the middle, indicating that someone or something pulled on it.

Obviously the cliff is not an option unless we want to find out what's down there (no, celine, we don't want to do that!). The guards are most likely still looking for us. There's quite a commotion on the road and bridge above us. The iron gate keeps moving up and down, riders on horses are leaving the city. We took a secluded path towards the mountains and walked in an unsuspicious pace, while still trying to get out of sight as quickly as possible.

Apparently we were not unsuspicious enough. After roughly half an hour of walking, we noticed horses flying towards us from behind. They were going to intercept us in any moment, and there was not really anywhere to go. Left and right of the path the terrain was steep. So steep that one might get fatally injured trying to climb down.

My companions panicked. We started sprinting further uphill in the hopes that there is something where we can find cover. At this point it was clear that an entire batallion of those bloodthursty fuckers was flying towards us. As they were about to reach us, we started to hear gunfire and flashes of light in front of us. Out of reflex we threw ourselves on the ground. The flying knights should have reached us by now, but they didn't. And after another moment we heard dwarfen voices yelling at us. The gunshots we heard came from these dwarves right in front of us. Lucky for us, they defended their mountain terrain against the Bretonnian knights, as they were about to invade the realm of the mountain dwarves.

The dwarves welcomed us after answering a silly question of theirs about the emperor's Greiff. Didn't believe that I was from the empire at first. But given who I travel with, it is kind of understandable. We are moving to their camp now to wash up and get some rest.

The dwarf escoritng us is called \emph{Bronzbeard}. That's his family name!

In a moment where dwarves were out of sight and we had some privacy, Celine revealed to us that hear real name is \emph{Cleo}. And her true form is actually that of a Tiefling. She's from the dead land. And she's a navigator by trait. I'm sure this will come in handy on our travels.

While we were resting, I unpacked the scroll that I suddenly found in my posession. So far I did not have a chance to look at it, and there is no clue where it came from and how it ended up in my backpack. Unfortunately the scroll makes no sense at all. There are symbols that look like characters, but noone in my party can read, let alone understand the language. For now we have no idea what's on it. The only thing we seem to know for sure is that the scroll is not magical. At least that's what Cleo said. When I touched the scroll however, I could feel how my emotions shifted and I felt at peace with myself and the world.

Back with the dwarves, we learned that the dwarf sergeant hates the \emph{grey beard dwarves}. Apparently these are dwarves that left the mountian dwarves here because they did not want to be part of this nation. I am not really sure if the grey beards have a beef with the mountain dwarves or the empire. The \emph{Edge of the world} is the only real place for dwarves according to Sergeant Tolfred Gorekson.

The dwarves keep calling us humans from The Empire \emph{"Husungis"}. They also have names for the different kinds of elves. I think they call the ones from the Forest \emph{"Woodelgi"}.

As Garret speaks Dwarven, he is asked to write down a grudge: "A grudge shall be issued against the region of the lands of paravon, for invading the grey mountains, curtosy of the dwarfs of caragnornt, with a considerable military force, forcing the brave defenders to defend themselves".

\emph{Sergeant Tolfred Gorekson} says orcs established an outpost in the abandonned dwarfen fortress Carog Ascaras. Their leader is \emph{Scarsnik}, a nasty Goblin.

Now Cleo and Gorekson are talking about walking trees. Apparently the woodelves don't like their walking trees either. Forest seem to be upset or something.

Sergeant is asking if we are going through Ubersreich. wants us to deliver something. But that would be the route over the gray lady's pass. There's an inn called \emph{Red Moon Inn} in Ubersreich, where the cousin of sergeant Torekson went to. This inn is known among apisiring adventurers who are looking for their first job. 

Garret told us that he is from Marienberg, but apparently there is not much that's holding him there and he does not really identify with the snobbish nature of the people in Marienberg.

Dwarfen guard told us not to go over the gray lady's pass. It's way too dangerous. We should travel along the forest and just not agitate the wood elves. He mentioend the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Don't make a fire
  \item Don't cut down trees
  \item Don't touch or look at the trees
  \item Don't throw the first axe
  \item When a tree starts moving, go away  
\end{itemize}


\section{Episode 4}
We are being told by Tofrek Gorekson, that the dwarves lost many holds to the Greenskins. Accoridng to Gorekson, the Greenskin's armies are getting more organized these days than in the past. It's even said they they bonded together with giant spiders.

Tofrek Gorekson says that if we should ever meet another Gorekson, we should tell him, that  Tofrek is working "on it". I suspect another of there grudge things. He was not really more specific than that.

Gorekoson's cousin is a mercenary in Uberstrike. Originally he wanted us to deliver a package to him, but since we are now not going to pass through uberstrike, that's not happening. We are actually on our way to Nuln. The dwarves are escorting us to the path that leads to Nuln. Also, I had to pay Gorekson 5 GP for a grudge he was about to write down, because I called the dwarves in Nuln dwarven spies.

The nearest dwarfen city is apparently Karagnorn.

We are supposed to go towards the small hills once we see them. First Northwest, then north.

We are on path now, left mountains, right forest. At one point Garet randomly decided to go inside the Forest, that we were told to ignore.

\section{Episode 5}
We ended up inside the forest on a "Lichtung". The ground is moving, roots are entangling our feet, but it actually feels good in some way. Garret said he can definitely detect some sort of magic in this place, but we don't know what it is. I think it's a prison actually, a really nice one at that.

Cleo is not really a big help either. She's hugging a tree and talking to him. But I don't think she's getting a response...

Darasras suggests that we set up camp here, and I agree. As long as we are safe from trolls and other beasts that's actually a good idea.

Suddenly Garret loses his shit, keeps saying it's dangerous and that we have to get out. He starts making his way backwards of where we came from, even uses his dagger to slash through some roots. As sudden as he started, he stops and apologizes. 

We are still discussing what to do and whether we should get out of here or not. 

Now we are debating whether we should stay here and rest, or walk through the forest.

Darasras, Belading and I are laying down to get some rest, while Garret and Cleo are staying up to keep watch. Good luck to us!

While we were sleeping, Garret and Cleo were greeted by an Elf named "Korrigash".
